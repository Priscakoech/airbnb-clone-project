# Technology Stack
Django is a high-level Python web framework used to quickly build secure and scalable web applications.
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is an extension of Django that simplifies building powerful RESTful APIs for your application.
PostgreSQL is a reliable and powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage application data.
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making data fetching more efficient.
Celery is used to handle background tasks like sending emails or processing data asynchronously, outside the main request-response cycle.
Redis is an in-memory data store often used with Celery to queue and manage background tasks quickly and efficiently.
Docker is a tool that packages your application and its dependencies into containers, making it easy to run consistently across different environments.
CI/CD Pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles, including setting their role as a guest or host. It ensures secure access to the platform and personalizes the experience for each user based on their role.

2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties by adding details like title, description, photos, price, and availability. This feature enables the platform to display available accommodations to guests and gives hosts control over their listings.

3. Booking System
Guests can check availability, select dates, and make reservations for properties. It manages reservation logic, prevents double-booking, and calculates the total cost, making it central to the platform's core functionality.

4. Payment Integration
This feature allows guests to securely pay for bookings using various payment methods. It ensures smooth, trackable transactions and helps build trust between users and the platform.

5. Review System
Guests can leave ratings and feedback after their stays, and hosts can view them. This promotes transparency and helps future guests make informed decisions based on past experiences.

6. Search and Filter
Guests can search for properties by location, price, availability, and other criteria. This enhances the user experience by helping guests find suitable properties quickly and efficiently.

# API Security
Authentication will be used to verify the identity of users, ensuring that only legitimate users can access their accounts and perform actions.

Authorization will control what each user is allowed to do based on their role, such as guests, hosts, or administrators, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions.

Rate limiting will be applied to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user or IP can make within a certain time frame. This helps defend against brute-force login attempts and denial-of-service attacks.

Input validation and sanitization will be enforced to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), which could compromise the system.

HTTPS will be used to secure all API communication, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.

API key management will be enforced for third-party integrations or internal services, requiring secure keys to access protected endpoints.

Logging and monitoring will be implemented to detect suspicious activity, support auditing, and enable fast incident response in case of a security event.

Data encryption at rest will be used to protect sensitive information stored in the database, such as passwords and payment details.

Protecting User Data: Users share personal information such as names, emails, phone numbers, and identification details. Securing this data prevents identity theft, privacy violations, and legal consequences for the platform.

Securing User Accounts: Strong authentication and session management ensure that only the rightful owners can access their accounts. This prevents account hijacking, unauthorized bookings, or malicious actions.

Authorization and Access Control: Clearly defined access levels protect sensitive areas of the system, ensuring, for example, that guests can’t edit host listings or that users can’t access admin functions.

Securing Payments and Financial Data: Payment processing involves handling credit card information or third-party wallet integrations. Security is essential to prevent fraud, chargebacks, and the exposure of financial details.

Preventing Abuse and Attacks (Rate Limiting): Rate limiting helps protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force logins, and spam. This ensures the system remains responsive and available to real users.

Preserving Data Integrity: Input validation and sanitization prevent attackers from tampering with data or injecting malicious code, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of property listings, reviews, and user profiles.

Ensuring Secure Communication (HTTPS): Encrypting data in transit protects sensitive information from being intercepted by attackers, especially when users connect over public networks.

Maintaining Trust and Reputation: Strong overall security builds user trust in the platform, encouraging users to share information, make payments, and use the service confidently without fear of compromise.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code every time changes are made. They help ensure that new features or updates are integrated smoothly and delivered quickly without breaking the project.

They are important for the project because they improve code quality, catch bugs early, reduce manual deployment errors, and speed up the development process.

Tools that could be used include GitHub Actions for automation, Docker for containerization, and Heroku or AWS for deployment.
